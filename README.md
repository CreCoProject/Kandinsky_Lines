# Kandinsky_Lines
This is the Kandinsky Lines Project. The Work for this Project was inspired
by the famous great Artist Wassily Kandinsky. He wrote the milestone Theorectical
Work Point to Line to Surface. In this Book he discussed the Elements of
Abstract Art. He discussed here among other things the Basicaly Shapes.
This Shapes was the Rectangle Triangle and the Circle. All of this
Shapes has the common that they are normaly boundered by Lines.
So the Idea of Lines would also been a them in his Book. In this Project
I will experiment with such Lines. This Lines are mainly different from
the Lines we known from the Geometry Lessons in Math. Here the Idea of
Lines are expanded to Curves and Bezier Curves. So the first thing I will
do is to show you Images in wich this kinds of Lines are togrether 
Composed and build the full Content of the Image.
